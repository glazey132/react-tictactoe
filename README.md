## Description

This is an implementation of the classic game, Tic-Tac-Toe that is built and powered by React.

## Running the game

You may either clone the repo to run it locally, or visit this url: https://blooming-peak-43227.herokuapp.com/ to play a version of my game that is hosted on a Heroku server. The following instructions are for cloning and running the game locally since playing the game via the aforementioned Heroku url is self explanatory.

## Running the game locally

- To run this project you must have an updated version of Node.js running in your shell terminal.
- Once you have an updated version of Node installed you may clone this repo by running `git clone https://github.com/glazey132/react-tictactoe.git` in your terminal.
- Once the project is installed locally, navigate to the game directory and run `npm install` in your terminal.
- Once the projects packages are installed run `npm start` in your terminal to run the game. A browser tab containing the game should automatically open.
- Enjoy!
